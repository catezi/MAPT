# Multi-Agent Preference Transformer (MAPT)

This is the official code repository for the paper "Decoding Global Preferences: Temporal and Cooperative Dependency Modeling in Multi-Agent Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning" accepted by AAAI 2024.

## Installation

### 1. Installing Dependences

``` Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Multi-agent MuJoCo

Following the instructios in https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py and https://github.com/schroederdewitt/multiagent_mujoco to setup a mujoco environment. In the end, remember to set the following environment variables:

``` Bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin;
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so
```

#### StarCraft II & SMAC

Run the script

``` Bash
bash install_sc2.sh
```

Or you could install them manually to other path you like, just follow here: https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.

#### Google Research Football

Please following the instructios in https://github.com/google-research/football. 

#### Bi-DexHands 

Please following the instructios in https://github.com/PKU-MARL/DexterousHands. 


### 2. Preparing Preference Data

Following our paper, we use script teachers to generate preference data.

Please download demonstrate preference data of several tasks from [here](https://bhpan.buaa.edu.cn/link/AAFAAAA5703BEA491E903A81CF6715F7C4).


## Model Training

### 1. Reward Modeling Phrase

- After installing dependences, you could run shells in the "scripts" folder.
- Run scripts end with `"reward.sh"`, for example `"train_smac_3m_reward.sh"`.
- Remember to set `--dataset_path` correctly to the path of your data set.
- Remember to set `log_dir` to the path you want to save log and model, which is set `'./results/pref_reward'` by defaught.

### 2. Policy Learning Phrase

- Run scripts end with `"policy.sh"`, for example `"train_smac_3m_policy.sh"`.
- Remember to set `--preference_model_dir` correctly to the path of pre-trained preference reward model.
